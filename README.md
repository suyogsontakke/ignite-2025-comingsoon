## 🚀 About This Project

This repository contains the official "Coming Soon" teaser page for the **IGNITE 2025** event. Its purpose is to build anticipation and capture early interest by directing users to the official Instagram and WhatsApp community channels before the main booking site is launched.

It is a lightweight, single-page, static website built with **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**. It features a visually appealing, space-themed design with pure CSS animations to create a dynamic and professional impression.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Visually Engaging Design:** Features a pure CSS animated starfield background and a pulsing glow effect on the main "IGNITE 2025" title to grab user attention.
* **Responsive Layout:** Fully responsive, mobile-first design built with Tailwind CSS that looks great on all devices.
* **Clear Call-to-Action:** Provides direct, prominent links for users to "Follow for Updates" on Instagram and "Join on WhatsApp".
* **Lightweight & Fast:** As a single static HTML file with no JavaScript logic, it loads extremely quickly.
* **Branding:** Uses the "Bebas Neue" and "Inter" fonts to maintain brand consistency with the main event.
* **Animated Content:** The main content box fades in on load for a smooth user experience.
